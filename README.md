# discord.ts

Discord4KaiOS - with a different approachðŸ˜‰

Attempt on making a library using TypeScript.

- This library uses svelte/stores, so it's very useful for a discord client that is written in svelte.
- supports zlib-stream, uses Discord Web's stolen pako implementation
- should work fine on nodejs
- Object Oriented approach, basically a discord.js knockoff lmao
- will try to be efficient as much as possible, will avoid making major changes
